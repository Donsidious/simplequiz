# Coding-Quiz


## Description

The project's aim was to create a coding knowledge testing environment for users. When the user clicks the Start Quiz button, a 90-second timer initiates. Each correct answer earns them ten points, while a wrong answer deducts ten seconds from their remaining time. After completing the quiz, users input their initials. The highest scorer's initials appear on the "High Score" page, and users can opt to restart the quiz. This project provided hands-on experience, highlighting the simplicity of jQuery for developers and the challenges of refactoring jQuery code into vanilla JavaScript. It underscored the importance of order of operations, code cleanliness, and organization.
